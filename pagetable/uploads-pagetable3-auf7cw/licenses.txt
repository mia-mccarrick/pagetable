The three licenses I reviewed were the GNU GPL, BSD, and Apache. The license I have chosen to use is the GPL. 

GPL: The General Public License asserts that users of the software have the freedom to run the code, modify it, share it with others as well as obtain its source code. 
However, users may not impose further restrictions on these rights. Also, licensee may offer their programs for free or for a fee. I chose this license because, as a student,
it's important for me that any program I write that someone wants to use, remains public, and that as many people can learn and benefit as possible.

BSD: The Berkeley Software Distribution is a permissive license which requires users to include the original copyright and attributions in all distributions
of their software and not use the name of contributers/organizations in the copyright to endorse or promote products without permission. Notably, the source code 
does not need to be distributed. I chose to not go with the permissive license because for my purposes, I have no interest in using my code commercially or keeping the 
source code private.


Apache: Apache is another permissive free license so users must include the same license in all unmodified parts including the copyright and attribution. Unlike 
BSD, however, this license requires users to include a notification of any modifications made. I chose not to use this license for essentially the same reason as above. 
If I am more focused on my own and others' learning, then I don't users to be able to hide their source code.
